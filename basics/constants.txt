// go supports both typed and untyped constants
// untyped constants are constants that are not associated with a type until they are assigned to a value
// typed constants are constants that are associated with a type
// go will infer the type of the constant based on the value assigned to it
// go will not infer the type of the constant if it is a complex expression
// go will not infer the type of the constant if it is a function call
// go will not infer the type of the constant if it is a method call
